my old basic dwm fork make sure you have awesome fonts installed ( the package for arch is ttf-font-awesome and for void linux its font-awesome )

the default terminal is alacritty

btw make sure to put my .xinitrc file in your home directory

and media keys work so enjoy

this is no longer being updated you should use https://github.com/opensky0/basic-dwm which sometimes gets changed
